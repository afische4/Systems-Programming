ifconfig --> shows a bunch of stuff like IP address, wifi, interface, ether is mac
hardware address
  --> first 3 blocks are company server/manufacturer ID

phones also have mac address associated with wireless eter whatever
  --> how places track you, knows where you connected to wifi because it uses
      you mac address
      --> NOW the can't do that it becomes spoofed by OS or make up new
          mac adress every time
mac addr tied to interface
LO=loopback device (no ethernet or hardware addr)
  -->not hardware. virtual device on every machine that is network enabled
    read same info back off loopback device when reconnecting or whatever
mtu = max packet size allowed on interface ~~ 1.5 kb for example
  --> a lot bigger on Loopback device, casuses problems because different sizes
      you can manually edit loopback to be lower/same as the other thing
You can open a socket and 'Listen' on particular port
  when listening on one port you are listening on only that port not another
EX)
netcat -l 9999 #-l means listen (w/out it means connect to)

netcat localhost 9999 (on loopback device)
hi
#can send things over to another terminal or whatever

bottom line = listen on a port connect to a port
if i give it explicitly a device I am binding the interface, so listening
on that port number bound to that interface. can specify localhost or not, if
not it will open on all of them

sudo tcpdump #prints all packets associated with interface
  #have to have permission to read all the packets
  #can be detected by OIT, can read everything off the network
  #OS tcpstack is detectable by ND OIT so don't try on school computer
sudo tcpdump -X icmp
  #display contents of packets (sudo allows you to run priveledged programs)
  #icmp are ping packets ex) ping google.com
sudo tcpdump -i lo port 9999 #listing on loopback interface #called handshake
                              #same as socket.connect "handshake"
(on another term) nc -l 9999
                  hi
                  hi

#when you connect also opening a port. 3 terminals 1 for listen, one for inter
face, one for tcpdump

nc localhost 9999 < temp/h.jpg
nc -l 9999

tcpdumb see size of packets (mtu of loopback device)

2 sides to connectio, listener and connector, sends packets back and forth,
  connecting to listener, so port open on both sides of connection,
    but usually only talk about listener side. # of ports determined by firmware
    managed by hardware

tcpdump opens network device and prints every packet (and contents) going by

restriction on max ports 65000 arbitrary determined by network that that was enough

When one protocol's packets or frames get encapsulated within another protocol 
there is an overall increase in the frame size. The encapsulation that takes 
place adds protocol header overhead, and thus the systems sending 1500-byte 
packets across the network cannot be sent in-tack to the other side. 
Some nodes that send 1500 byte packets into the DMVPN and subsequently 
receive an ICMPv4 “packet too big” message from the router may choose to 
ignore this.

One method to test and detect a reduced MTU size is to use a ping with 
a large packet size. Here are some examples of how to do this.

C:\Users\ScottHogg> ping -l 1500 192.168.10.1

OR

~$ping -s 1500 -M do 192.168.10.1

#ALL THIS WILL BE ON TEST
