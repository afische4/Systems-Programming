# Systems Programming - Daily 1

DUE: Aug 12 by class start

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using the shell.  You will need to log into a remote shell, navigate to the homework directory, read a file (this one!), and answer a few basic questions.

## The Questions

1) What are the four main parts of an operating system?  Give a one sentence description of each.

2) What was the key motivation for making the Unix operating system?

3) When you "ssh to student01" and type "date", why might the time differ between what is printed on the shell and what is printed on your computer's GUI clock?

## Grading

This assignment is worth just one point.  I will give full credit for any reasonable answers, and correct any "completely wrong" answers via discord/email or in the next lecture.

## Turn in

Turn in this assignment by answering the questions above via Discord in a DIRECT message to me.  (Do not use the general public chat to post your answers, please.)

Note that in future assignments I will ask you to use the courseware dropbox.
